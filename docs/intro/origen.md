# Data origin
Most of the information contained in the QuienEsQuienWiki API comes from datasets released by different institutions of the Mexican State, specifically the ones regarding public contracting from the Ministry of finance and public control. Additionally, there are datasets from other countries, civil society organizations, access to public information requests, and journalism/media.

In every case, each query will include original sources for each piece of data, so they can be independently verified by the user. Considering the info will not always be available, a timestamp with the date and time when the info was first added to the QuienEsQuienWiki database is included.

Use [/sources](endpoints#sources) to know the full list of available sources.
