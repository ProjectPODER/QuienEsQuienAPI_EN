## ## Get data for TowerBuilder
TowerBuilder is our contracting data visualization website generator, oriented to big infraestructure projects. The main goal of this tutorial is to explain how the open contracting data that requires this application is obtained using QuienEsQuien.wiki API.

For this tutorial we will use the linux command line, which will allow us to download the data making queries to the API.

This tutorial is not yet finished, if you wish to use the API, please email us at info@quienesquien.wiki
